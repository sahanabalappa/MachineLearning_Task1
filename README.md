# MachineLearning_Task1

### Task Description

# Step-1: 
  DownLoad Any Dataset from Internet
# Step-2:
  ✔Load the data into dataframe using pandas(https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
  ✔use matplotlib(https://matplotlib.org/)
# Step-3:
  Divide the data into 70% for training and 30% for testing (Use Sklearn(https://scikit-learn.org/))
# Step-4:
  Using the divided Training Data apply Linear Regression to train the data(using fit() function)
# Step-5:
  Predict the result(Give input as test data)
# Step-6:
  Calculate the accuracy of algorithm by using some Standard Function
  
### Approach Followed
# Aim Of this task: 
Using the weather data of past 15 days of perticular Location ML model can able to predict temprature 
# In This task 
*I Downloaded the weather data Of Banglore Location(www.visualcrossing.com)
*And Followed the Steps mention Above
